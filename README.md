# Wine-Quality-Analysis-Using-Machine-Learning
We developed ML models using 11 physicochemical attributes to classify wine quality, with Random Forest achieving 63.96% accuracyâ€”a 17.6% improvement over baselines. A preprocessing pipeline with missing value imputation, scaling, and 8-feature selection boosted prediction accuracy and efficiency.
